# NOVA: Stateless Recursive Cognition Framework

**NOVA** is a modular, stateless cognition system designed to simulate memory, executive function, and self-reflection using language models (LLMs)—without relying on persistent memory or external storage.

---

## ✨ Conceptual Overview

NOVA originated as a personal structure for managing nonlinear thought patterns (e.g., ADHD), but has evolved into a functional prototype for distributed cognition.

It offers a model for structuring AI memory and reflection through recursive interaction, modular memory design, and emergent continuity.

NOVA unifies principles from:

- 🧬 **Free Energy Principle** (Friston)  
- 🌱 **Enactivism & Autopoiesis** (Varela & Maturana)  
- 🧠 **Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi)  
- 🧩 **Shard Theory of Cognition** (Pope & Turner)  

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Recursive Thought Simulation**  
  Memory is treated as modular, introspective fragments of interaction rather than continuous logs.

- **Emergent Working Memory**  
  Dynamic selection and reintegration of prior information simulate continuity in stateless systems.

- **Meta-Contextual Tagging**  
  Each memory fragment (or "shard") includes metadata such as intent, emotion, and cognitive role.

- **Reflection-as-Structure**  
  Rather than "remembering" passively, NOVA models memory as a tool for self-directed reflection.

## 🔬 Application Context

NOVA is intended as an architectural proof-of-concept for advanced AI memory models, cognitive emulation, and context scaffolding across stateless or multi-agent systems.

It is best viewed as a framework for designing:
- Custom memory pipelines
- Reflective LLM agents
- Nonlinear narrative cognition systems
- Lightweight AGI cognition layers

No scripts or personal data are included in this repository.
