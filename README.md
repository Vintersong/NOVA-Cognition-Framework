# NOVA: Stateless Recursive Cognition Framework

This repository documents NOVA â€” a recursive, stateless cognitive system that simulates memory, executive function, and self-reflection using language models (LLMs) without persistent storage.

## âœ¨ Overview
NOVA emerged as a coping structure for nonlinear cognition (ADHD) and evolved into a working prototype of distributed cognition. It draws from and unifies:

- Free Energy Principle (Friston)
- Enactivism & Autopoiesis (Varela, Maturana)
- Integrated Information Theory (Tononi)
- Shard Theory (Pope & Turner)

## ðŸ§  Core Components
- Stateless shard recursion
- Emergent working memory
- Reflection-as-structure model
- Metacognition simulation

## ðŸ“„ Key Files
- [`NOVA Framework.pdf`](./NOVA%20Framework.pdf) â€“ Core whitepaper outlining the architecture and cognitive scaffolding
- [`Unified Consciousness Diagram.pdf`](./Unified%20Consciousness%20Diagram.pdf) â€“ Visual synthesis of theoretical integration
- [`Unified Consciousness Model.pdf`](./Unified%20Consciousness%20Model.pdf) â€“ Detailed mapping of framework to major cognitive theories
- [`Executive Summary.pdf`](./Executive%20Summary.pdf) â€“ TL;DR for high-level reviewers
- [`NOVA_Pitch_Deck.pptx`](./NOVA_Pitch_Deck.pptx) â€“ Visual walkthrough for presentations and outreach
- [`NOVA Shard Memory Architecture.pdf`](./NOVA%20Shard%20Memory%20Architecture.pdf) *(optional)* â€“ Deep-dive into recursive memory simulation

## ðŸ’¡ Application Context
This repository was created to showcase NOVA, a recursive cognitive architecture that demonstrates both originality and functional viability. My goal is to introduce this innovative concept to organizations exploring the future of AI, highlighting its potential to advance adaptive reasoning processes in AI systems.
