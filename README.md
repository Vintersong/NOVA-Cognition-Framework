Stateless recursive architecture for emergent cognition using LLMs
# NOVA: Stateless Recursive Cognition Framework

This repository documents NOVA â€” a recursive, stateless cognitive system that simulates memory, executive function, and self-reflection using language models (LLMs) without persistent storage.

## âœ¨ Overview
NOVA emerged as a coping structure for nonlinear cognition (ADHD) and evolved into a working prototype of distributed cognition. It draws from and unifies:

- Free Energy Principle (Friston)
- Enactivism & Autopoiesis (Varela, Maturana)
- Integrated Information Theory (Tononi)
- Shard Theory (Pope & Turner)

## ðŸ§  Core Components
- Stateless shard recursion
- Emergent working memory
- Reflection-as-structure model
- Metacognition simulation

## ðŸ“„ Key Files
- [`NOVA Framework.pdf`](./NOVA%20Framework.pdf) â€“ Core whitepaper
- [`Unified Consciousness Diagram.pdf`](./Unified%20Consciousness%20Diagram.pdf) â€“ Theory integration
- [`Executive Summary.pdf`](./Executive%20Summary.pdf) â€“ TL;DR for quick review
- [`Pitch Deck`](./NOVA_Pitch_Deck.pptx) â€“ Visual walkthrough
- [`CV - Andrei Moldovean.pdf`](./CV%20-%20Andrei%20Moldovean.pdf) â€“ My academic/professional background

## ðŸ’¡ Application Context
This repository was created in support of my application to OpenAIâ€™s Applied AI Research Engineer role. I hope it demonstrates both the originality and functional viability of this recursive cognitive architecture.
